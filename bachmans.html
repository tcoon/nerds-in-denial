  <p style="width: 70%">Hey guys, Don Bachman here. I'll keep this quick - I wanted to digitize my storefront of the highest quality mussel deterrent apparatuses, but it turned out to be more work than I anticipated. That ad somehow got pushed out to production without my say, I told em to wait. No one checks their email anymore...</p>
  <p style="width: 70%">So anyway, you get this page for now. I'm workin on it, alright? In the meantime, come on down to my store, Bachman's Dock Disks. Over on East and Alexander. Ya know the place. Your water vessel will thank you.</p>
